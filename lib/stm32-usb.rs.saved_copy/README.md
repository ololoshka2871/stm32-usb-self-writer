# stm32-usb.rs

Experimental [UF2](https://github.com/microsoft/uf2) bootloader written in rust.

Ignore the `hardware` folder - the PCB may work but I didn't bother getting it manufactured in the end as the bluepill was sufficient for my needs.

Check out the [firmware/usb_bootloader](firmware/usb_bootloader) folder for more info.
